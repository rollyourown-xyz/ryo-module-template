# ryo-module-template

This is the template repository structure for a [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) module.

---

The general architecture of rollyourown.xyz projects and modules is documented [here](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/project_and_module_development/general_architecture/)

The structure of a rollyourown.xyz module (which this template provides) is documented [here](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/project_and_module_development/module_structure/).

## How to Use this Template

Clone this repository as a starting point for a new module and make the following changes:

- If needed, add additional parameters for the module in the [`configuration/configuration.yml`](./configuration/configuration.yml) configuration file, and change the [`module_id`](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/project_and_module_development/module_structure/#the-project_id) for the new module
- Add additional Ansible playbooks, roles and tasks for module-specific host setup in the [`host-setup`](./host-setup/) directory
- Add [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks for each module component in the [`image-build`](./image-build/) directory
- Add [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) files in the [`module-deployment`](./module-deployment/) directory
- Modify the scripts in the [`scripts-module`](./scripts-module/) directory, if necessary
- Update the [`README`](./README.md) for the new module

This template README can be used for the new module by deleting this part, changing the title and introductory text above, and completing the sections below.

Deploy <MODULE_PURPOSE> using Ansible, Packer and Terraform.

## Module Summary

This module uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy ...,  as a module for other [rollyourown.xyz projects](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/projects/).

_A short summary of the purpose of the module._

## How to Use

A [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz/) module contains automation code to configure, build, deploy, maintain, back up and restore a module for use by other rollyourown.xyz projects.

In itself, a module doesnâ€™t provide a full end-to-end service, but rather provides a reusable building block that is used in a full rollyourown.xyz project as part of the end-to-end solution for that project.

A detailed description for project developers of how to use this module in a project can be found in the [module's documentation](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/project_modules/<MODULE_NAME>/).
